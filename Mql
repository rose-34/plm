Command Syntax Notation
	.In the syntax definition of the command,words in lower case are keywords. Examples are:add,print,help.When type into MATRIX,they may consist of mixed lower and upper case.
	
	.Items in UPPER CASE refer to categories. Examples are NAME VALUE. When typed into MATRIX, appropriate substiturions of actual names or values must be used.Note that names/values are case sensitive.
	
	.Items in squere brackets, [] , aer optional.
	
	.Items in braces , {} ,may appear zero or more times.
	
	.Items stacked between vertical lines are options of which one must be chosen.  That is:
	
	| item_1 |
	|    .   |
	|    .   | means choose one of the items
	|    .   |
	| item_1 |
	
	.MATRIX commands are entered as a free form list of words separated by one or more blanks, or newlines.Command lines should end with a semicolon(;).However,a command is also assumed ended when two consecutive newlines are entered.
	
	.Text appearing after a pound sign(#),up to and including the next newline,is ignored as a comment
	
	.NAMES,VALUE, etc.must be quoted (single or double) when they have embedded blanks,tabs,newlines,commas,semicolons,or pound signs.
	
	.Any keyword that accepts a list of VALUE (eg. keyword[VALUE {.VALUE}]) may also be specified separately for each value.For example:
		attribute first,second,third
			or
		attribute first
		attribute second
		attribute third
	
	.Most keywords may be abbreviated to three characters(or the least number that will make them unique)
